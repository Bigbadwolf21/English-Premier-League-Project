# English-Premier-League-Project
This is a project I did exposing me into the world of Sport Analytics. Football Analytics precisely. In this project I tried to predict the winner of an English Premier League Match; whether the Home Team or the Away Team using Random Forest Classifier. I also tried to gain insights from the given data. The data was gotten from footbal-data.co.uk
